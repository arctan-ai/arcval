"""Async sliding-window rate limiters keyed by provider+endpoint.

Used to keep outbound provider API calls under per-account RPM caps. A
limiter tracks request timestamps in a deque; ``acquire()`` evicts entries
older than ``period`` and sleeps until the oldest in-window timestamp ages
out when the window is full.

Sarvam streaming limits (per account, sourced from the Sarvam dashboard):

- STT streaming (``speech_to_text_streaming.connect``): 20 RPM
- TTS streaming (``text_to_speech_streaming.connect``): 60 RPM

    """Sliding-window async rate limiter.

    ``acquire()`` returns once the call can proceed without exceeding
    ``max_calls`` over ``period`` seconds. Safe under concurrent awaiters
    within a single event loop — the ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes the
    window check so two coroutines cannot both observe a free slot and
    overshoot the cap.

    Designed for the calibrate CLI usage pattern: one ``asyncio.run`` per
    process, all Sarvam calls inside it. Not safe across multiple
    ``asyncio.run`` invocations or across threads — the lock binds to the
    first event loop that contends on it.
