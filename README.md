CLI for [Calibrate](https://calibrate.artpark.ai): an AI evaluation platform for non-profits

With [Calibrate](https://calibrate.artpark.ai), you can move from slow, manual testing to a fast, automated, and repeatable testing process for your entire agent stack:

- `Text to Text (LLMs)`: Evaluate the response quality and tool calling of your LLMs for multi-turn conversations and find the find LLM for your agent
- `Human alignment`: Create LLM judges to make your evaluations scalable and reliable with human in the loop.
- `Speech to Text (STT)`: Benchmark multiple providers (Google, Sarvam, ElevenLabs and more) on your dataset across 10+ indic languages using metrics optimised for agentic use cases
- `Text to Speech (TTS)`: Benchmark generated speech by multiple providers automatically using an Audio LLM Judge across 10+ indic languages
- `Simulations`: Simulate realistic conversations using realistic user personas and scenarios to test failure modes for your agent (including interruptions for voice agents)

Calibrate is built on top of [pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat), a framework for building agents.
